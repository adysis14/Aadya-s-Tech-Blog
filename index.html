                        <h1>Cryptography</h1>
                        <p>Cryptography is the art of changing a message from a readable format, referred to as
                            “plaintext”, into an unreadable one, or “ciphertext”. This process is referred to as
                            “encrypting” the message.
                            <br>
                            In most cases, there needs to be a way to change it back to a
                            readable format, or “decrypting” it, but not always. There are three main types of
                            cryptography in use today.</p>

                <p> Today, we are in the middle of the deepest recession in living memory. As pandemic-triggered
                    lockdowns took hold around the world in early 2020, economies contracted quickly. The International
                    Monetary Fund and World Bank foresee a global contraction in economic output in 2020 of around –5
                    percent; the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development estimates an even worse result, at
                    –7.6 percent. At any rate, the drop will far exceed the last global contraction, which was –1.7
                    percent in 2009</p>

                    <br>
                    Right now, they are talking about how to scale their automation programs beyond the most obvious
                    process bottlenecks that proved RPA is for real. However, many companies do not know to
                    systematically design a system to uncover what to automate next.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>
                <p>When a star ventures a little too close to a black hole, the intense tidal forces suck into it like a
                    giant noodle of star stuff in a cosmic (and much more chaotic) reenactment of that iconic scene in
                    “Lady and the Tramp.” The black hole’s extreme gravitational pull shreds the star into thin strands
                    of material—a process delightfully called “spaghettification.” When these noodle-like strips get
                    sucked into the black hole, they release a powerful bright flare of energy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In September of 2019, the light from such a doomed encounter reached Earth. An international team of
                    researchers, using a fleet of telescopes from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), monitored the
                    flare—dubbed AT2019qiz—for a six-month stretch as it grew brighter then faded away. The phenomenon,
                    known as a tidal disruption event, is detailed in a new study published last week in Monthly Notices
                    of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p>
